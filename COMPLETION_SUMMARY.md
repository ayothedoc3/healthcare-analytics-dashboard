## Technical Highlights

### 1. Production-Quality Backend

```typescript
// Clean service architecture
@Injectable()
export class AnalyticsService {
  // Dependency injection
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(Patient) private patientRepo: Repository<Patient>,
    @InjectRepository(Appointment) private appointmentRepo: Repository<Appointment>,
    @InjectRepository(Revenue) private revenueRepo: Repository<Revenue>,
  ) {}

  // Parallel execution for performance
  async getOverview(query: AnalyticsQueryDto) {
    const [patients, appointments, revenue] = await Promise.all([
      this.patientRepository.count(),
      this.appointmentRepository.count({ where: dateFilter }),
      this.calculateTotalRevenue(dateFilter),
    ]);
    return { /* aggregated metrics */ };
  }
}
```

### 2. Optimized Database Schema

```sql
-- Strategic indexing for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_appointment_status ON appointments(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointment_date ON appointments(appointmentDate);
CREATE INDEX idx_patient_email ON patients(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_revenue_date ON revenue(date);
```

### 3. Type-Safe Frontend

```typescript
// End-to-end type safety
interface OverviewMetrics {
  totalPatients: number;
  totalRevenue: number;
  // ... fully typed from backend to frontend
}

const overview = await apiClient.getOverview(); // Type-safe!
```

### 4. Modern UI Components

```tsx
<StatCard
  title="Total Revenue"
  value={formatCurrency(overview.totalRevenue)}
  icon={DollarSign}
  iconColor="bg-green-500"
/>
```

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# Automated testing and deployment
- Backend tests → Build → Docker image
- Frontend tests → Build → Docker image
- All checks pass before merge
```
